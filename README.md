## Project Theme 9 - Open Innovation 

# Inferno - Gaming Website
<br/>
Inferno is like a library for people for who like to know about the most popular games, get their ratings and reviews and even see their trailer video. ðŸ¤©<br/>
Not only this they can also search for any game they wish to play and buy them from available play stores!<br/>
We plan to implement the above idea using the following public API : <br/>
https://rawg.io/apidocs <br/>

### Tasks completed
<br/>
- Used the API to fetch popular, upcoming and new games.<br/>
- Created cards for every game in each of the mentioned categories.<br/>
- Fetched game ratings, images and summary of the game.<br/>
- On clicking the card, the details of the game can be seen.<br/>
- Minimized the images fetched from API.
- Adding animations.
- User will see all the above functionalities on the homepage.<br/>
